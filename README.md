# Dice Game

A simple, interactive two-player dice game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Play

- The game is played by two players who take turns rolling a dice.
- On each turn, a player rolls the dice as many times as they wish, adding the dice number to their current score.
- If the player rolls a 1, their current score for that turn is lost and the turn passes to the other player.
- A player can choose to "Hold", which adds their current score to their total score and passes the turn to the other player.
- The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
